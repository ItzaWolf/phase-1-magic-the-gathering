# Magic: The Gathering | DeckBuilder

Magic: The Gathering DeckBuilder is a frontend website that is capable of creating a custom deck, searching and adding cards using filters and names, and an Inventory system that persists upon revisit! This is Possible using an external API called Scryfall!

## Installation

You will need a personal server to run this off of. You can achieve this by running this command in your terminal: 
```terminal
json-server --watch db.json
```

There is no additional installation required! Just start the server and everything should work!
